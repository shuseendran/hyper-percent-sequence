## Abstract
The Hyper-Percent Sequence (HPS) is a mathematical framework that unifies percent, ppm, ppb, and finer concentration scales into a single ordered hierarchy of proportional resolution. Instead of treating each unit as independent notation, HPS establishes a continuous sequence describing fractional precision levels, conceptually analogous to hierarchical growth in hyper-operations.

## Concept
Percent = “parts per hundred” → PPM = “parts per million” → PPB = “parts per billion,” etc.  
HPS defines these as levels of **resolution scaling**, not isolated measurement units.

General hierarchy:
HPS_n = parts / 10^n  
Where n = 2 gives percent (10²), n = 6 gives ppm (10⁶), n = 9 gives ppb (10⁹), extending indefinitely.  
Thus, percent, ppm, ppb… become **members of a single infinite proportional system**.

## Motivation
Like addition → multiplication → exponentiation unify arithmetic, HPS unifies proportional measurement across fields:
- Finance → percent
- Chemistry/Environment → ppm/ppb
- Nano-science, biotech, cosmology → extreme ratios

HPS provides a consistent language & theoretical foundation for comparing fractional magnitudes across scales.

## Significance
HPS frames percent-based units as **precision operators** on real values, enabling:
- Cross-field ratio standardization  
- Analytical formulas for scaling transitions  
- Proportional algebra & calculus  
- Unified fractional scaling language across sciences

## Historical Context
Percent comes from Latin “per-centum.” PPM/PPB evolved later for scientific precision.  
HPS systematizes them under **one theoretical architecture**, like unification of rationals/irrationals into real numbers.

## Future Directions
- Symbolic notation for nth hyper-percent level  
- Algebra & calculus under proportional scaling  
- Precision-based numeric computation  
- Applications in physics, environmental science, finance, information theory

## Conclusion
HPS formalizes percent-based units as a hierarchical mathematical structure for proportional precision. It reframes everyday percent and scientific ppm/ppb as steps in a unified continuum, creating a theory for fractional scaling at all magnitudes.
